;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This allows to schedule reviews of org entries.
;;
;; Entries will be scheduled for review if their NEXT_REVIEW or their
;; LAST_REVIEW property is set. The next review date is the
;; NEXT_REVIEW date, if it is present, otherwise it is computed from
;; the LAST_REVIEW property and the REVIEW_DELAY period, such as
;; "+1m". If REVIEW_DELAY is absent, a default period is used. Note
;; that the LAST_REVIEW property is not considered as inherited, but
;; REVIEW_DELAY is, allowing to set it for whole subtrees.
;;
;; Checking of review dates is done through an agenda view, using the
;; `org-review-agenda-skip' skipping function. This function is based
;; on `org-review-toreview-p', that returns `nil' if no review is
;; necessary (no review planned or it happened recently), otherwise it
;; returns the date the review was first necessary (NEXT_REVIEW, or
;; LAST_REVIEW + REVIEW_DELAY, if it is in the past).
;;
;; To mark an entry as reviewed, use the function
;; `org-review-insert-last-review' to set the LAST_REVIEW date to the
;; current date. If `org-review-sets-next-date' is set (which is the
;; default), this function also computes the date of the next review
;; and inserts it as NEXT_REVIEW.
;;
;; Example use.
